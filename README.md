# react-starter

Starter template for react projects. 
Inspired by [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate) 
and [react-starter](https://github.com/webpack/react-starter).

## Features

* Webpack
* ES2015 with Babel
* ESLint
* React
* Redux
* CSS Modules
* Live code updates
* Karma + Mocha for tests
* Code coverage with isparta
* Just NPM (no yeoman, gulp, bower,...)

## Getting started

To run the development server just run:

    npm start
    
The rest of the commands available can be found in `package.json`:

* `test` for running the tests (without coverage)
* `coverage` for running the tests with coverage (proper for CI servers)
* `build` for production builds
* `clean` is kinda obvious
* `lint` for code linting

Coverage reports are created with different formats under the `coverage` dir. 

Production build can be found in the `dist` folder.
